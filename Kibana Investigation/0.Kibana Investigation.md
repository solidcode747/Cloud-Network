2. Answer the following questions:

    - In the last 7 days, how many unique visitors were located in India?
      224 visitors

    - In the last 24 hours, of the visitors from China, how many were using Mac OSX?

               **

3. Now that you have a feel for the data, Let's dive a bit deeper. Look at the chart that shows Unique Visitors Vs. Average Bytes.
     - Locate the time frame in the last 7 days with the most amount of bytes (activity). 
     - In your own words, is there anything that seems potentially strange about this activity?  **Yes, this very heavy traffic is happening at in the middle of the  night.  Perhaps someone may be trying to hack or steal data.  It seems very suspicious that we see that volume of traffic during the day, whem most real activities and day to day business takes place.***

4. Filter the data by this event.
     - What is the timestamp for this event? **2021-03-18  9:00pm**
     - What kind of file was downloaded? **a gz compressed file**
     - From what country did this activity originate? **china**
     - What HTTP response codes were encountered by this visitor? **code 200, OK.**

5. Switch to the Kibana Discover page to see more details about this activity.
     - What is the source IP address of this activity?  
     - What are the geo coordinates of this activity?
     - What OS was the source machine running?
     - What is the full URL that was accessed?
     - From what website did the visitor's traffic originate?

6. Finish your investigation with a short overview of your insights. 

     - What do you think the user was doing?
     - Was the file they downloaded malicious? If not, what is the file used for?
     - Is there anything that seems suspicious about this activity?
     - Is any of the traffic you inspected potentially outside of compliance guidlines?
